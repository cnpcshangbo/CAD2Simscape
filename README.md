# CAD2Simscape
A Quadrotor drone model imported to Simscape from SolidWorks. 

I imported CAD Quadrotor model from https://github.com/cnpcshangbo/simscapeFOPD/tree/master/QuadRotor/CAD

After importing the model is only physical model, modifications are needed to make it a drone model that can move.
